Originally limited to the analysis of single time series or images, a definition of multivariate multifractal analysis, i.e., the joint multifractal analysis of several data components, was recently proposed and was shown to effectively quantify local or transient dependencies in data regularity, beyond linear correlation. However, the accurate estimation of the associated matrix-valued joint multifractality parameters is notoriously difficult, thus limiting its practical usefulness. Leveraging a recent statistical model for bivariate multifractality, the goal of this work is to define and study Bayesian estimators designed to bypass this difficulty. Specifically, we study the original use of two different priors, combined with two different averages (arithmetic and Karcher means), for bivariate multifractal analysis. Monte Carlo simulations with synthetic data allow us to appreciate their relative performance and to conclude that our novel and original estimator based on a scaled inverse Wishart prior and the Karcher mean yields particularly favorable results with up to 5 times smaller root-mean-squared error than previous formulations.","tags":["Multifractal analysis","multivariate data","Bayesian estimation","wavelet leaders","Karcher mean"],"title":"A Comparison of Bayesian Estimators for the Parameters of the Bivariate Multifractal Spectrum","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Herwig Wendt","Lorena León","Jean-Yves Tourneret","Patrice Abry"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1666051200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666051200,"objectID":"87ef476d6b5d11b389543632878afb51","permalink":"https://lorena-leon.github.io/publication/icip_22/","publishdate":"2022-10-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/icip_22/","section":"publication","summary":"Multifractal analysis provides a global description for the spatial fluctuations of the trengths of the pointwise regularity of image amplitudes. A global image characterization leads to robust estimation, but is blind to and corrupted by small regions in the image whose multifractality differs from that of the rest of the image. Prior detection of such zones with anomalous multifractality is thus crucial for relevant analysis, and their delineation of central interest in applications, yet has never been achieved so far. The goal of this work is to devise and study such a multifractal anomaly detection scheme. Our approach combines three original key ingredients i) a recently proposed generic model for the statistics of the multiresolution coefficients used in multifractal estimation (wavelet leaders), ii) an original surrogate data generation procedure for simulating a hypothesized global multifractality and iii) a combination of multiple hypothesis tests to achieve pixel-wise detection. Numerical simulations using synthetic multifractal images show that our procedure is operational and leads to good multifractal anomaly detection results for a range of target sizes and parameter values of practical relevance.","tags":["anomaly detection","multifractal analysis","surrogate data","wavelet leaders","log-cumulants"],"title":"Multifractal Anomaly Detection in Images via Space-Scale Surrogates","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lorena León","Herwig Wendt","Jean-Yves Tourneret","Patrice Abry"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1656460800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1656460800,"objectID":"9c231b753e99a589c6e72927fa6dae2e","permalink":"https://lorena-leon.github.io/publication/tsp_22/","publishdate":"2022-06-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tsp_22/","section":"publication","summary":"Multifractal analysis has become a reference tool for signal and image processing. Grounded in the quantification of local regularity fluctuations, it has proven useful in an increasing range of applications, yet so far involving only univariate data (scalar valued time series or single channel images). Recently the theoretical ground for multivariate multifractal analysis has been devised, showing potential for quantifying transient higher-order dependence beyond linear correlation among collections of data. However, the accurate estimation of the parameters associated with a multivariate multifractal model remains challenging, especially for small sample size data. This work studies an original Bayesian framework for multivariate multifractal estimation, combining a novel and generic multivariate statistical model, a Whittle-based likelihood approximation and a data augmentation strategy allowing parameter separability. This careful design enables efficient estimation procedures to be constructed for two relevant choices of priors using a Gibbs sampling strategy. Monte Carlo simulations, conducted on synthetic multivariate signals and images with various sample sizes and multifractal parameter settings, demonstrate significant performance improvements over the state of the art, at only moderately larger computational cost. Moreover, we show the relevance of the proposed framework for real-world data modeling in the important application of drowsiness detection from multichannel physiological signals.","tags":["Multifractal analysis","multivariate","Bayesian estimation","multiscale","wavelet leaders"],"title":"A Bayesian Framework for Multivariate Multifractal Analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lorena León","Herwig Wendt","Jean-Yves Tourneret","Patrice Abry"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1638921600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1638921600,"objectID":"00049111d0f209149ac921b7819c5610","permalink":"https://lorena-leon.github.io/publication/eusipco_21/","publishdate":"2021-12-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/eusipco_21/","section":"publication","summary":"Multifractal analysis is a reference tool for the analysis of data based on local regularity and has proven useful in an increasing number of applications involving univariate data (scalar valued time series or single channel images).
