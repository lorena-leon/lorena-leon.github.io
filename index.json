Though successfully applied in a large number of applications in very different contexts, the estimation of parameters related to the data multifractality is an intricate issue for discrete real-world data in non-standard situations, e.g., for small sample size or in the presence of data corruptions. Building upon a recently introduced generic statistical model for log-leaders, specific multiresolution quantities designed for multifractal analysis, the present work proposes a novel robust model and estimator for the multifractality parameter that quantifies the degree of multifractality in data. Our model explicitly accounts for certain data corruptions as outliers in the spectral log-leader domain. Moreover, we propose an original expectation-maximization algorithm for estimating the parameters associated with the model. Several Monte Carlo simulations have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed estimator, which confirm its good performance when compared to standard linear regression in the presence of different additive or multiplicative data perturbations.","tags":["Multifractal analysis","wavelet leaders","robust estimation","expectation-maximization"],"title":"A Robust Model and its EM Algorithm for the Estimation of the Multifractality Parameter","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lorena León","Herwig Wendt","Jean-Yves Tourneret"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1684540800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1684540800,"objectID":"e1f77c0fef39190926064ac32d3ee6c9","permalink":"https://lorena-leon.github.io/publication/sigproc_23/","publishdate":"2023-05-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sigproc_23/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper derives and studies Bayesian Cramér-Rao lower bounds for the mean squared error of covariance matrices that are structured as weighted sums of symmetric positive definite matrices associated with a circularly-symmetric Gaussian statistical model.

Originally limited to the analysis of single time series or images, a definition of multivariate multifractal analysis, i.e., the joint multifractal analysis of several data components, was recently proposed and was shown to effectively quantify local or transient dependencies in data regularity, beyond linear correlation. However, the accurate estimation of the associated matrix-valued joint multifractality parameters is notoriously difficult, thus limiting its practical usefulness. Leveraging a recent statistical model for bivariate multifractality, the goal of this work is to define and study Bayesian estimators designed to bypass this difficulty. Specifically, we study the original use of two different priors, combined with two different averages (arithmetic and Karcher means), for bivariate multifractal analysis. Monte Carlo simulations with synthetic data allow us to appreciate their relative performance and to conclude that our novel and original estimator based on a scaled inverse Wishart prior and the Karcher mean yields particularly favorable results with up to 5 times smaller root-mean-squared error than previous formulations.","tags":["Multifractal analysis","multivariate data","Bayesian estimation","wavelet leaders","Karcher mean"],"title":"A Comparison of Bayesian Estimators for the Parameters of the Bivariate Multifractal Spectrum","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Herwig Wendt","Lorena León","Jean-Yves Tourneret","Patrice Abry"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1666051200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666051200,"objectID":"87ef476d6b5d11b389543632878afb51","permalink":"https://lorena-leon.github.io/publication/icip_22/","publishdate":"2022-10-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/icip_22/","section":"publication","summary":"Multifractal analysis provides a global description for the spatial fluctuations of the trengths of the pointwise regularity of image amplitudes. A global image characterization leads to robust estimation, but is blind to and corrupted by small regions in the image whose multifractality differs from that of the rest of the image. Prior detection of such zones with anomalous multifractality is thus crucial for relevant analysis, and their delineation of central interest in applications, yet has never been achieved so far. The goal of this work is to devise and study such a multifractal anomaly detection scheme. Our approach combines three original key ingredients i) a recently proposed generic model for the statistics of the multiresolution coefficients used in multifractal estimation (wavelet leaders), ii) an original surrogate data generation procedure for simulating a hypothesized global multifractality and iii) a combination of multiple hypothesis tests to achieve pixel-wise detection. Numerical simulations using synthetic multifractal images show that our procedure is operational and leads to good multifractal anomaly detection results for a range of target sizes and parameter values of practical relevance.","tags":["anomaly detection","multifractal analysis","surrogate data","wavelet leaders","log-cumulants"],"title":"Multifractal Anomaly Detection in Images via Space-Scale Surrogates","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lorena León","Herwig Wendt","Jean-Yves Tourneret","Patrice Abry"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1662681600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1662681600,"objectID":"e603eb8e2ad9066760ac6370f5e2fbb7","permalink":"https://lorena-leon.github.io/publication/gretsi_22/","publishdate":"2022-09-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gretsi_22/","section":"publication","summary":"Multifractal has nowadays become a standard tool in modern signal and image processing, mostly used to characterize scale-free spatial or temporal dynamics.
