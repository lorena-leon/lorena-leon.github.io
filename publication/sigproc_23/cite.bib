  abstract = {This paper derives and studies Bayesian Cramér-Rao lower bounds for the mean squared error of covariance matrices that are structured as weighted sums of symmetric positive definite matrices associated with a circularly-symmetric Gaussian statistical model. This model naturally appears in a number of important applications, including multivariate multifractal analysis and vector-valued additive Gaussian processes. As an intermediary result, we derive a novel expression for the expectation of compositions of Wishart random matrices. We provide extensive numerical simulation results for analyzing the derived bounds and their properties, and illustrate their use for the multifractal analysis of bivariate time series.},
